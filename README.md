  ## Description  
  This is an API for a social network that uses a NoSQL database that allows the servers to handle large amounts of unstructured data. This database allows for users to create, update and share or delete their thoughts, add friends or react to another user's thoughts. Users may also be deleted, this will in turn delete all thoughts or reactions associated with that user.
